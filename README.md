# Tidal-Locking
Modelling tidal friction on natural satellites

Variations in gravitational forces on the surface of natural satellites cause orbits to lose rotational angular momentum. A tetrahedron joined by springs is introduced to allow these differentials to distort the shape of a satellite. A dashpot (damper) is used to dissipate energy through tension in the springs as a result of these tidal bulges. We manage to predict the time-scale of tidal locking to within one order of magnitude.
